# Material Components for Vue

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pgbross/vue-material-adapter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pgbross/vue-material-adapter)

This is the Vue 2 (legacy) version of `vue-material-adapter`, for the Vue 3 version see the `main` branch.

Vue components (Vue 2.0) for [Material Web Components](https://material.io/components/web/) which uses the
[`Using Foundations and Adapters`](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/blob/master/docs/integrating-into-frameworks.md#the-advanced-approach-using-foundations-and-adapters) integration technique.

This project defines Vue components that use the `Material Components Web` library to implement Material Design.mization while sticking to the _Vue Spirit_ (approachable, versatile, and performant)
